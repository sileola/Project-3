I ran the following commands on my virtual machine to update a list of packages in the Ubuntu package manager and to upgrade the Ubuntu OS:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt upgrade`

Nex, I gott the location of Node.js software from Ubuntu repositories by running the command below:

`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -`

Next, to install Node.js on the server, I ran the command below:

`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Thereafter, to verify the not installations, I ran the following commands:

`node -v `

`nmp -v`
