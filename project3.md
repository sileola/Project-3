I ran the following commands on my virtual machine to update a list of packages in the Ubuntu package manager and to upgrade the Ubuntu OS:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt upgrade`

Nex, I gott the location of Node.js software from Ubuntu repositories by running the command below:

`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -`
